## NOTES
- Static Rendering is useful for UI has no data or has data that is shared across users, such as a static blog post or a product page. But it might not be a good fit for a dashboard that has data that is regularly updated.

##### Static Benefits
- Faster Websites - Prerendered content can be cached. This ensures that users around the world can access your website's content more quickly and reliably.
- Reduced Server Load - Because the content is cached, your server does not have to dynamically generate content for each user request.
- SEO - Prerendered content is easier for search engine crawlers to index, as the content is already available when the page loads. This can lead to improved search engine rankings.
